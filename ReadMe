Problem 1:
My program runs by dedicating 1 thread at a time to adding elements to the concurrent linked list while the other three wait either for the semaphore to free up. After they add an element to the list, if the list is not empty, they then remove one element and write a thank you note.
It takes user input from the keyboard to run and runs on Java. It is likely not the best way to do the problem but it works which is the most important thing.
